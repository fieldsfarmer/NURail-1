  <p class="feature-text">Three rail related projects were taken on as part of the  year long Senior Design Capstone class. Two rail projects were also part of the Freshman Design class. During the spring of 2014 students in the Railroad Engineering class designed and constructed a 60 foot section of track at the Wabash Valley Railroaders Museum.  The track is used to display  a WW II  Pullman Troop Sleeper car.
